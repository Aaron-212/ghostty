# Control and Escape Sequences

‚ö†Ô∏è **This is super out of date. Ghostty's support is much better
than this document seems. TODO to update this.** ‚ö†Ô∏è

This is the list of control and escape sequences known in the ecosystem
of terminal emulators and their implementation status in ghostty. Note that
some control sequences may never be implemented in ghostty. In these scenarios,
it is noted why.

Status meanings:

- ‚úÖ - Implementation is complete and considered 100% accurate.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è - Implementation works, but may be missing some functionality. The
  details of how well it works or doesn't are in the linked page. In many
  cases, the missing functionality is very specific or esoteric. Regardless,
  we don't consider a sequence a green checkmark until all known feature
  interactions are complete.
- ‚ùå - Implementation is effectively non-functional, but ghostty continues
  in the face of it (probably in some broken state).
- üí• - Ghostty crashes if this control sequence is sent.
