# Send-Receive Mode (SRM)

<VTMode value={12} ansi={true} />

If reset, characters entered by the keyboard are shown on the screen
as well as being sent to the running program. If set, keyboard input
is sent only to the running program and the running program can choose
whether it wants to echo it back.

This mode is typically enabled on terminal startup.

This mode is generally unsupported across most terminals today and
is recommended to be retired.[^1]
