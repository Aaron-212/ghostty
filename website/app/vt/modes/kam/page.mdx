# Keyboard Action Mode (KAM)

<VTMode value={2} ansi={true} />

Disable all keyboard input.

This mode is unset as part of both [full reset (RIS)](/vt/ris)
and [soft reset (DECSTR)](/vt/decstr).

A poorly behaved terminal program can lock the terminal emulator
using this command. Terminal emulators should provide a mechanism
to reset this or outright disable it.

## Validation

### KAM V-1: Disable Keyboard Input

```bash
printf "\033[1;1H" # move to top-left
printf "\033[0J" # clear screen
printf "Keyboard input is now disabled.\n"
printf "\033[2h"
sleep 5
printf "\033[2l"
printf "Keyboard input is re-enabled.\n"
```
