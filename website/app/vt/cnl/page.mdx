# Cursor Next Line (CNL)

<VTSequence sequence={["CSI", "Pn", "E"]} />

Move the cursor `n` cells down and to the beginning of the line.

The parameter `n` must be an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `n` is less than
or equal to 0, adjust `n` to be 1. If `n` is omitted, `n` defaults to 1.

The logic of this sequence is identical to [Cursor Down (CUD)](/vt/cud)
followed by [Carriage Return (CR)](/vt/cr).
