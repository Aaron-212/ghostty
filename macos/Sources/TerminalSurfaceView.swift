/// A surface is terminology in Ghostty for a terminal surface, or a place where a terminal is actually drawn
/// and interacted with. The word "surface" is used because a surface may represent a window, a tab,
/// a split, a small preview pane, etc. It is ANYTHING that has a terminal drawn to it.
///
/// We just wrap an AppKit NSView here at the moment so that we can behave as low level as possible
/// since that is what the Metal renderer in Ghostty expects. In the future, it may make more sense to
/// wrap an MTKView and use that, but for legacy reasons we didn't do that to begin with.
