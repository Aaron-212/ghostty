## About

ghostty is a cross-platform, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator that aims to
push the boundaries of what is possible with a terminal emulator by exposing
modern, opt-in features that enable CLI tool developers to build more feature
rich, interactive applications.

There are a number of excellent terminal emulator options that exist
today. The unique goal of ghostty is to have a platform for experimenting 
with modern, optional, non-standards-compliant features to enhance the 
capabilities of CLI applications. We aim to be the best in this category, 
and competitive in the rest.

While aiming for this ambitious goal, ghostty is a fully standards compliant
terminal emulator that aims to remain compatible with all existing shells
and software. You can use this as a drop-in replacement for your existing
terminal emulator.

**Project Status:** Pre-Alpha. This project is not ready to be used as a
day-to-day terminal emulator. It can't even render vim yet!

## Roadmap

The high-level ambitious plan for the project, in order:

| # | Step | Status |
|:---:|------|:------:|
| 1 | Standards-compliant terminal emulation     | ❌ |
| 2 | Competitive rendering performance (not the fastest, but fast enough) | ❌ |
| 3 | Basic customizability -- fonts, bg colors, etc. | ❌ |
| 4 | Richer windowing features -- multi-window, tabbing, panes | ❌ |
| 5 | Optimal rendering performance | ❌ |
| N | Fancy features (to be expanded upon later) | ❌ |
