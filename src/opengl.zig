//! These are pupose-built for usage within this program. While they closely
//! align with the OpenGL C APIs, they aren't meant to be general purpose,
//! they aren't meant to have 100% API coverage, and they aren't meant to
//! be hyper-performant.
//!
//! For performance-intensive or unsupported aspects of OpenGL, the C
//! API is exposed via the `c` constant.

//! WARNING: Lots of performance improvements that we can make with Zig
//! comptime help. I'm deferring this until later but have some fun ideas.
